Under voltage: The input voltage of the external power system is below the lower limit.Possible causes include: insufficient electricity supply,air switch is not enough,the diameter of power cable is not enough,the length of power cable is too long. Power-down: The input voltage of the external power supply system is interrupted. Insufficient power supply capacity: The external power supply equipment or batteries do not have a sufficient load-carrying capacity, resulting in an alarm of insufficient power supply capacity due to an under-voltage-related calibration failure. The possible reasons are insufficient mains electricity supply,a low air circuit breaker capacity,a small power cable diameter,and a too long power cable.",2023-07-04 00:08:34,"",ME(MO SDR),U RNCId: 3010; Under voltage; voltage: 0.0V; Board serial number: 253971701352; U nodeBId:362,Unacknowledged,"","","","","","","",UMTS,6321,1662661135105,10.248.182.206,"","OMCB_RNC_3355Z_DNG,RNC_3355Z_HUE(3355)",OMCB_RNC_3355Z_DNG,Platform Alarm,"","",362,3G_PLC046M_HUE,SDR,362,3G_PLC046M_HUE,PM,"product:public,wcdma",uid=362#uuserlabel=#ufid=362#,The input voltage is abnormal,""
