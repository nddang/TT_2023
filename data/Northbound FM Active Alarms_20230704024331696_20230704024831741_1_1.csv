Power-down: The input voltage of the external power supply system is interrupted. Insufficient power supply capacity: The external power supply equipment or batteries do not have a sufficient load-carrying capacity, resulting in an alarm of insufficient power supply capacity due to an under-voltage-related calibration failure.
